    <p class="aboutUs">Our bodies may be built in the kitchen, but that doesn’t mean that flavour
    needs be left at the door. At Amyzing Lifestyle, we live to eat rather than eat to live. 
    With our simple easy to follow recipe books you can be cooking up a storm in no time. No 
    matter if it’s bulking in winter or cutting in summer, we can help you do it right and at 
    the right price too. The recipes we have are more likely to burst your taste buds than 
    break your budget. As part of the premium service Amyzing Lifestyle will allow you to 
    create fantastic meals around the ingredients in your cupboards or plan a couple of 
    tasty dishes based off a weekly shop.</p>
